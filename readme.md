# runtime modules for type checking on MicroPython

This repo is a test of a few different ways to support type checking in MicroPython. 

The goal is to be able to run code on a MicroPython board that contains include statements and typing annotations unchanged.

By default the  `typing` module is not included in MicroPython. 
This repo contains an experiment in enhancing the modules
 - `typing`, 
 - `typing_extensions`, 
 - `abc` 
 - `collections.abc` 
 - `__future__`, 
in MicroPython as a cross-compiled module or frozen code.
